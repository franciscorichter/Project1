First PhD project by Pancho.


I will have to use often:

First download:

```
git clone https://github.com/franciscorichter/Project1
```

Update:

```
git pull
```

After modifying a file, commit the changes:

```
git add --all :/
git commit -m "My changes"
```

Upload to GitHub:

```
git push
```
