# Diversity-dependence model with EM approach.

This package consists on a set of tools for the EM approach to reconstruct phylogenetic trees developed under my PhD project. 

### Important functions on this package are: 

```phyl2``` -> to generate complete phylo trees

```mle_dd`` -> to calculate mle of complete trees

```reconst_tree2`` -> to reconstruct trees

```mle_dd_setoftrees``` -> mle calculation for a set of trees



Please see P1usage.R if you do not know how to start.
